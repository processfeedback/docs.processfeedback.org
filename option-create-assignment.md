# Create an Assignment in Process Feedback

---

In this approach, Process Feedback allows you to create a question, collect student submissions, and review all responses in a single dashboard. It effectively functions as a lightweight learning management system. And neither you nor your students need to create an account to use Process Feedback.

After you create an assignment in Process Feedback:
1. You will receive a unique link to share with students
2. When students open the link, the assignment appears at the top of the editor
3. After completing the assignments, students can review their writing process and submit their work
4. As submissions come in, you can track them all from a single dashboard

### Step 1. Inform students in advance—don’t surprise them 

Students should be informed in advance that you are interested not only in their final product but also in their working process. Include a note in your course syllabus or send an announcement at the beginning of the semester. Here is an [example classroom announcement](./classroom-announcement.md).

### Step 2. Create an assignment and share the link with your students

You can create an assignment [here](https://app.processfeedback.org/createassignment). After you create an assignment, you will see instructions that you can share with your students. When you share the instructions with students, remember to remind them that they must use the link you provide them to type their work.

### Step 3. Try the submission link yourself

After creating an assignment the first time, try the submission link yourself once and verify that your submission appears in the teacher dashboard.
