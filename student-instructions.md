# Student Instructions

---

Students must use Google Docs or Process Feedback for their writing. If they type in a different application, such as Microsoft Word, they won’t be able to explore their writing process. Add the instructions below to any assignment where a student’s writing process matters.

### Additional Assignment Requirements

This assignment must be completed using an online editor that records your typing. Doing so will allow you to analyze your writing process and share the writing process report.

**Step 1. Use Google Docs or Process Feedback**  

For this assignment, use Google Docs as usual or Process Feedback's [online writing editor](https://write.processfeedback.org). Typing in another editor (such as Microsoft Word) and pasting the text later is **not allowed**. Use Google Docs or Process Feedback’s editor for your entire writing process. If you use Google Docs, you **must be online while you are typing**.

**Step 2. Submit your final work**  
Submit a PDF or DOC file of your final writing. 

**Step 3. Submit your writing process report**   
Also submit the process report as a PDF. If you use Process Feedback’s online editor, you can download the report from the sidebar on the left.

NOTE: If you use Google Docs, you can install the [Process Feedback extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gdoc-process-feedback/chcbikmmlhbbdkfiaaaljabpefdfajnb) to generate a process report for your document. The extension page includes a short tutorial video on installing the extension and downloading the report. Alternatively, you may submit an edit link to your Google Doc with the “Anyone with the edit link can edit” option enabled. For instructions on generating an edit link, refer to [this tutorial](how-to-provide-edit-access-in-gdocs.md).
