Steps to share your writing process report with a teacher  

---

## Step 1. Write in Google Docs or in Process Feedback

Type in Google Docs as usual. A common mistake is writing in another editor, such as Microsoft Word, and then pasting the text into Google Docs. Editors like MS Word do not track the editing process. *You must use Google Docs for the entire writing process.*

As an alternative to Google Docs, you can use Process Feedback's [online editor](https://write.processfeedback.org).

## Step 2. Share your document or your writing process report

### Option 1: Share the Google Docs document itself

If you are using Google Docs, you can share the edit link to your document by enabling the **“Anyone with the edit link can edit”** option. Step-by-step instructions for generating an edit link are provided in [this tutorial](./how-to-provide-edit-access-in-gdocs.md).

### Option 2: Obtain and share a link to your writing process report 

If you typed in Google Docs, install the [Process Feedback extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gdoc-process-feedback/chcbikmmlhbbdkfiaaaljabpefdfajnb) to generate a process report for your document. The extension page includes a short tutorial video on installing the extension. 

Once the report is open, click “Share this Report” in the sidebar to obtain the link to your writing process report.

If you typed in Process Feedback's writing editor, you can save the document online and copy the Report Link to share with others.

### Option 3: Download and share a PDF of your writing process report

In some cases you may not need a full interactive report link, and a PDF of your report may be enough. To obtain a PDF, click "Download Report PDF" in the sidebar on the left.

### Option 4: Download and share a writing-process data ZIP

Regardless of whether you typed in Google Docs or the Process Feedback editor, you can download a ZIP file of your writing-process data and share the ZIP file. This can help bulk-analyze multiple writing processes at once.
