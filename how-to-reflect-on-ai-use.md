# How to reflect on your generative AI use

---

These activities invite you to explore and reflect on your writing process and use of generative AI. The prompts help you spot patterns and gain insights into your writing habits.

### Step 1: Open your writing process report generated by Process Feedback

Start by reviewing your writing process reports from past assignments. Use the online version (not the PDF) so you can click and explore the charts.

### Step 2: Create a table of generative AI usage

List **all** instances where you sought help from generative AI (GAI) tools. For each usage, include:

* Date & time
* GAI tool used
* Purpose (describe the reason for using the tool)
* Process (describe the steps you took in using the tool)
* On a scale of 1 to 5, how helpful was this AI usage for creating the final product? Give a rating of five if all of the AI-generated text or ideas remain in the final document and one if none remain.
* On a scale of 1 to 5, how helpful was this AI usage for your overall writing process?

Here is how the table may look:

| # | Date & Time | GAI Tool | Purpose | Process | Helpful for Final Product | Helpful for Process | 
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | 
| 1 | 2/4/2025 4:45 PM | ChatGPT | Generating initial list of ideas | Asked for ideas on flying watches | 5 | 1 | 
| 2 | 2/4/2025 4:50 PM | ChatGPT | Polishing grammar and readability of text | Pasted a paragraph and asked it to fix grammar | 2 | 4 | 

### Step 3: Identify the most helpful GAI usage

From your table, choose the instance you found most beneficial and explain why. Support your explanation with details of the interaction, tool/platform, and helpful features.

### Step 4: Identify the least helpful GAI usage

From your table, choose the instance you found least helpful and explain why it was not effective. Include specific details and any context for why it didn’t work well.

### Step 5: Discuss your lessons learned

Reflect on any insights you gained about using AI in your writing. Consider how this experience will change or inform your approach to AI tools in future writing tasks. Write a 5- to 10-line reflection on your insights. Use these questions as a prompt:

* What was your most important learning in using AI in your writing, and why?
* What lessons will you take away with you and apply in future?
* What do we leave behind? Have your attitudes or ideas changed, and if so, why?

### Step 6: Submit your reflection

Submit a single document containing the questions above followed by your responses. Be sure to include specific examples, dates, and times from your writing process report to support your points.
