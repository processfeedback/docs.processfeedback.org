# Try or Integrate Process Feedback

---

Using Process Feedback in a class involves two key steps. First, inform your students in advance about what to expect. Next, provide them with instructions on how to use it.

### Step 1. Inform students in advance—don’t surprise them 

Students should be informed in advance that you are interested not only in their final product but also in their working process. To do this, include a note in your course syllabus or send an announcement at the beginning of the semester. Here is an [example classroom announcement](./classroom-announcement.md).

### Step 2. Require students to use Google Docs or Process Feedback's online editor

Students must use Google Docs or Process Feedback's [online editor](https://write.processfeedback.org) for their writing. If they type in a different application, such as Microsoft Word, they won’t be able to explore their writing process because those tools do not record full edit history. 

### Step 3. Ask students to share their writing process report

Provide step-by-step instructions to students for them to share their writing process report. Here is an [example](./student-instructions.md).

### Step 4. As a separate assignment, ask students to reflect on their writing process

> “We do not learn from experience, we learn from reflecting on experience.” ― John Dewey

After completing their writing assignments, students should be prompted to reflect on their writing process. [Here are some prompts](./writing-process-reflection-prompts.md) for encouraging students to reflect on (or discuss) their writing process.

### (Optional) Step 5. Ask students to reflect on generative AI usage

In some assignments, students may be allowed to use generative AI for specific phases of their writing process. Reflecting on the use of AI may require a different set of prompts. [Here are some prompts](how-to-reflect-on-ai-use.md) for reflecting on the use of generative AI in the writing process.

When students type in Google Docs, they don't have to install the Process Feedback extension because Google Docs automatically records the full edit history. If students prefer to use the Process Feedback online editor, they do not need to create an account.
