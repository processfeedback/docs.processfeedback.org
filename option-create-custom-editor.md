# Create Custom Editor in Process Feedback

---

Process Feedback allows you to personalize the writing editor for your students. You can create a custom editor that displays your course name (or your name) at the top of the sidebar, helping students feel more engaged as they type. You can also match the editor’s color scheme to your institution's branding. Once created, the editor link remains valid for an entire term.

Creating a custom editor takes just a few steps. After setting it up, you will receive a unique link to share with students. Your students can start using the link immediately and don’t need to create an account.

Neither you nor your students need to create an account to use Process Feedback.

Using Process Feedback in a class involves two key steps. First, inform your students in advance about what to expect. Next, provide them with instructions on how to use it.

### Step 1. Inform students in advance—don’t surprise them 

Students should be informed in advance that you are interested not only in their final product but also in their working process. Include a note in your course syllabus or send an announcement at the beginning of the semester. Here is an [example classroom announcement](./classroom-announcement.md).

### Step 2. Create a custom editor and share the link with your students

First create a custom editor [here](https://app.processfeedback.org/createeditor). Students must use the editor you provide for their writing. If they type in a different application, such as Microsoft Word, they won’t be able to explore their writing process because those tools do not record full edit history.

When you create a custom editor, you will see instructions that you can share with your students.

### Step 3. Ask students to share their writing process report

Provide step-by-step instructions to students for them to share their writing process report. Here is an [example](./student-instructions.md).

### Step 4. As a separate assignment, ask students to reflect on their writing process

> “We do not learn from experience, we learn from reflecting on experience.” ― John Dewey

After completing their writing assignments, students should be prompted to reflect on their writing process. [Here are some prompts](./writing-process-reflection-prompts.md) for encouraging students to reflect on (or discuss) their writing process.

### (Optional) Step 5. Ask students to reflect on generative AI usage

In some assignments, students may be allowed to use generative AI for specific phases of their writing process. Reflecting on the use of AI may require a different set of prompts. [Here are some prompts](how-to-reflect-on-ai-use.md) for reflecting on the use of generative AI in the writing process.

# Curious how a custom editor looks like?

[Here](https://app.processfeedback.org/writing/?th=940000&cid=ENG%20101&cn=Introduction%20to%20Creative%20Writing) is a custom editor created for the course ENG 101. Notice how the sidebar on the left displays the course name.
